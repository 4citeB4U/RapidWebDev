# **The Single-File Architecture Explained: Simplicity & Performance**
## Our unique Single-File Architecture means your entire website-HTML, JavaScript/React, and CSS/Tailwind-is contained within one index.html file. It loads React, Babel, and Tailwind from CDNs, compiles JSX in-browser using Babel Standalone, and renders UI with React. Benefits include simple deployment, fewer HTTP requests, conceptual clarity, and offline potential. However, trade-offs include reduced code-splitting and caching granularity, large initial load size, and no traditional build tool optimizations. Ideal for: Brochures, portfolios, landing pages, prototypes, and rapid deployments where simplicity and fast first-paint matter most.
