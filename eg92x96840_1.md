# **CSS Styling Guide (with Tailwind CSS)**
## Introduction to Tailwind CSS in Our Application Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework where styling is applied directly within HTML (or JSX) using pre-defined classes. Why Tailwind CSS? - Rapid development - Consistent design system - Highly customizable - Smaller CSS bundles via purge - Responsive design built in How We Use Tailwind: We include Tailwind via a CDN in the head of our HTML file and use utility classes in our JSX. Common Classes: - Layout: `flex`, `grid`, `p-6` - Typography: `text-xl`, `font-bold` - Colors: `bg-black`, `text-white` - Borders: `rounded-lg`, `shadow-xl` - Transitions: `hover:bg-blue-700`, `transition-colors` Example: <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2">Click Me</button>

## We also include custom animations in the style block of the HTML for effects like `bounce`, `glitch`, and `rotate3d`.
